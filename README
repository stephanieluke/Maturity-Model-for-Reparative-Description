For more about this model and the larger trends of this study, see the article “Instituting a Framework for Reparative Description,” published in Archival Science (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10502-024-09435-z).

The authors developed a maturity model specific to the work of reparative description following interviews with 30 librarians and archivists at 19 institutions in the United States. This tool can be used for benchmarking, assessment, and continuous improvement both within and between institutions. 

The categories for this model include:
Leadership
Process
Implementation
Documentation
Metrics and Impact
Community Relationships
Sustainability
Support

The authors encourage you to download and use this model, tailor it to your needs, and share the results. Please let us know what you learn! We'll update this GitHub with future revisions and versions.
